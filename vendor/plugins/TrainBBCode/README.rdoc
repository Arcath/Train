= Train BBCode

Rails Gem for BBCode

== Install

=== As a Gem

gem install trainbbcode

For rails you will need to add:

config.gem "trainbbcode"

to config/enviroments.rb

== Optional Requirements

=== Ultraviolet

If you want to use syntax highlighting you will need to install the "ultraviolet" gem

Once you have the gem installed you will need to run:

    uv -s ruby --copy-files css
    gief css filez



== Usage

This adds a method to string of .tbbc which lets you parse the code like this:

  "[b]bold text[/b] and [i]italic[/i]".tbbc

that would output:

  "<strong>bold text</strong> and <i>italic</i>"

Or you can configure it by creating a TBBC object and running "conf"

  tbbc=TBBC.new
  tbbc.config(:strong_enabled => false)
  tbbc.parse("[b]bold text[/b] and [i]italic[/i]")
  
This would output:

  "[b]bold text[/b] and <i>italic</i>"
